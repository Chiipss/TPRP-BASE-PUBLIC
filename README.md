# TPRP-BASE-PUBLIC

TPRP files are now public for anyone to use.

If you know the server you know how much work has been put into this server.

Do with it what you will, Run it as one or take code from it. 

I will not help you start the server, 

Make sure:

You change Tokovoip IP,
Add your licence key,
Add your SteamAPI key,
Load the SQL file,
Check server.cfg for other settings.

MAKE SURE YOU USE TXADMIN WITH THIS SERVER or shit will break.

Enjoy.
