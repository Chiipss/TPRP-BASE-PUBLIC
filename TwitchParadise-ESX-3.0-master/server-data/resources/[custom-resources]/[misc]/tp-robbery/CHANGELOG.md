Added money and weapons to the loot table.
Examples are in the config.lua, under the 'entertainment unit' table (for a loot stash that uses weapons, items and money as a reward),
and the 'drawers' table (for a loot stash that outputs absolutely nothing... just an example).
Make sure you set the proper 'RewardAccount' (in the main config table) to your desired account. 

NOTES: If for some reason, your players aren't getting the correct amount of ammo on receiving a gun (e.g: receiving 250 bullets every time instead of random would be the "incorrect amount"),
your ESX is heavily outdated. Update that to fix the issue.
